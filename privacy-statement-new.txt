PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR LŒRN APP

Last Updated: February 5, 2026

---

INTRODUCTION

This privacy statement explains how lœrn ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information.
lœrn is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your learning data should always remain under your control.

Except where you explicitly choose to export or share content, lœrn does not transmit your data outside your device.

---

CORE PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

Privacy-First Design  
lœrn is built from the ground up to protect your privacy:

- Offline-first by design: Core learning features work without an internet connection
- No user accounts: No registration, no login, no passwords
- No tracking: No behavioral analytics, no profiling
- Local-only data storage: Learning data stays on your device unless you explicitly export or share it
- User control: Data leaves your device only through actions you intentionally initiate

---

DATA WE DO NOT COLLECT

We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:

- Personal information (name, email address, phone number, address)
- User accounts or authentication credentials
- Learning content or study materials you create or import
- Learning progress, scores, or statistics
- Usage analytics or telemetry data
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Location data
- Contact lists or social connections

For free users, advertising partners may receive limited technical data as required to display ads (see Advertising section below).

---

DATA STORAGE

Local Storage Only  
All learning-related data is stored exclusively on your device:

- Learning decks and flashcards
- Study progress and statistics
- Review history and spaced repetition data
- User preferences and settings
- Local profile information (profile name, icon, language preference)

This data is stored in a local SQLite database within the app’s private storage and is protected by your device’s built-in security mechanisms (iOS Data Protection, Android Keystore).

No Cloud Synchronization  
lœrn does not provide cloud sync, cloud backup, or server-side storage.  
We do not operate servers that receive or store your learning data.

---

INTERNET CONNECTIVITY

Offline Learning Core  
The core learning functionality of lœrn is fully offline and does not require network access.

Advertising (Free Version Only)  
If you use the free version of lœrn, the app displays advertisements. Only the advertising module accesses the internet in order to:

- Load advertisement content
- Report ad impressions and interactions
- Comply with advertising network requirements

The learning core itself does not transmit learning data, content, or progress.

Advertising Partners  
The free version uses Google AdMob. AdMob may collect certain information according to its own privacy policy, which may include:

- Device advertising identifier
- IP address
- Device type and operating system
- Ad interaction data

For details on Google’s data practices, see:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

Premium Version  
If you purchase the premium version (one-time purchase):

- All advertisements are removed
- The advertising module is not initialized
- The app does not require internet access for normal use
- No network communication is performed by the app

---

IN-APP PURCHASES

Purchase Processing  
Premium purchases are processed entirely by Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

- We do not collect or store payment information
- We do not receive credit card or billing details
- We only receive confirmation that a purchase was completed

Premium status is stored locally on your device.  
The purchase is tied to your App Store or Play Store account, not to any lœrn account.

---

IMPORT, EXPORT, AND SHARING

Local File-Based Import and Export  
lœrn allows you to import and export learning decks using JSON or ZIP files:

- Imported files are processed locally on your device
- Exported files contain only learning content (questions, answers, metadata)
- Exported files do not include personal identifiers by default

User-Initiated Sharing  
You may choose to share exported files using your device’s standard sharing features.

Important clarifications:

- Data is shared only when you explicitly initiate sharing
- lœrn does not automatically transmit data
- lœrn does not know who you share data with
- Once shared, data is handled by the receiving app, service, or recipient according to their own privacy practices

You are solely responsible for how and where exported files are shared.

Copyright and Content Responsibility  
lœrn is a tool, not a content provider. You are responsible for:

- Ensuring you have the right to use imported content
- Complying with copyright laws when sharing exported decks
- The legality of any materials stored or shared using the app

---

PROFILES

Multi-Profile Support  
lœrn supports multiple local user profiles on a single device:

- Each profile has isolated learning data
- Profiles are identified only by a name and icon you choose
- Profile data is stored locally and never transmitted by the app
- Deleting a profile permanently removes its data from the device

Premium Status  
Premium purchase status applies to all profiles on the same device and store account.

---

NOTIFICATIONS (OPTIONAL)

Learning Reminders  
You may optionally enable learning reminders:

- Reminders are scheduled locally on your device
- No external servers are used for reminder delivery
- You can disable reminders at any time
- Notification permissions can be revoked in device settings

---

PERMISSIONS

The app may request the following permissions:

Storage (Android)  
- Purpose: Importing and exporting deck files
- Scope: Only files you explicitly select

Internet (Free Version Only)  
- Purpose: Displaying advertisements
- Not used: Premium version

Notifications (Optional)

- Third-party tracking SDKs

---

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

lœrn is intended for university students and older learners.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction).

Because lœrn does not collect personal data, it is compliant with children’s privacy regulations such as COPPA.

---

DATA SECURITY

Local Device Security  
Your data is protected by:

- Device-level encryption
- App sandboxing
- Your device’s authentication mechanisms

No Server Risk  
Because lœrn does not store data on servers, there is no risk of:

- Server breaches
- Cloud data leaks
- Unauthorized third-party access

Your Responsibility  
You are responsible for:

- Securing your device
- Managing device backups (iCloud / Google backup)
- Safely storing exported files

---

YOUR RIGHTS AND CONTROL

You have full control over your data:

- All learning data is stored locally
- You can export data at any time
- You can delete decks or profiles
- Uninstalling the app removes all local data

---

DATA RETENTION

On-Device Only  
Data remains on your device until you:

- Delete content or profiles
- Clear app data
- Uninstall the app

No Server Retention  
We do not retain data on servers because we do not operate any.

Device Backups  
If enabled, your operating system may back up app data according to its own policies. This is controlled by Apple or Google, not by lœrn.

---

LEGAL BASIS (GDPR)

For users in the EEA:

- We do not process personal data as a controller
- Advertising (free version) is based on legitimate interest
- You can avoid advertising by purchasing the premium version

---

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (CCPA)

- We do not sell personal information
- We do not share personal information for marketing
- Most CCPA obligations do not apply due to lack of data collection

- Data is stored locally on your device
- We do not operate servers
- Data leaves your device only through user-initiated sharing

---

We will notify users by:
