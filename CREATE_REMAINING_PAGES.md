# Remaining Pages to Create

Due to the large number of files (40+ pages across 4 languages), I've created the core structure.

## Completed:
- ✅ Shared CSS (style.css)
- ✅ Root index.html with language detection (de, en, fr, es, it, nl)
- ✅ English (en) - ALL 8 pages complete
- ✅ German (de) - ALL 8 pages complete  
- ✅ French (fr) - Started (index.html, about.html created)

## To Complete:
### French (fr) - 6 more pages needed
### Spanish (es) - 8 pages needed
### Italian (it) - 8 pages needed
### Dutch (nl) - 8 pages needed

I'll now create all remaining pages in batches.
