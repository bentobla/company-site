You are a senior web developer, UX writer, and information architect.

Task:
Design and implement a multi-page company website for
"Jetzt & Dahanna Technologies" (jetztunddahanna.com).

High-level positioning:
- Small, independent company
- Builds focused, practical applications using artificial intelligence
- Clear stance: "Good AI" – pragmatic, restrained, useful use of AI
- Not an AI hype brand and not anti-AI
- AI is treated as a tool, not as a solution for every problem
- The company must NOT appear as a classic software agency,
  development studio, or engineering consultancy

Core product and business principles:
- No subscriptions
- No dark patterns
- No user profiling or data harvesting
- Monetization is transparent and minimal
- Users remain in control of features and data
- AI is only used where it provides clear, understandable value

Tone & writing constraints:
- Calm, precise, and confident tone
- Avoid marketing language and buzzwords
  (e.g. "disruptive", "cutting-edge", "scalable")
- Avoid exaggerated or emotional claims about AI
- Avoid developer-centric bragging (code quality, architecture, tooling)
- Focus on judgment, restraint, and clarity
- Prefer short paragraphs and clear statements

Technical constraints:
- The website must be implemented as a static site
- Plain HTML and CSS only
- No build step
- No framework assumptions
- No JavaScript unless strictly necessary
- Fully compatible with GitHub Pages hosting

Design & interaction principles:

Overall design intent:
- Calm, confident, and minimal
- Visual restraint is intentional
- The site should feel closer to a well-designed product interface
  than to a marketing landing page

Layout & structure:
- Clear visual hierarchy through spacing and typography
- Generous whitespace
- Limited number of visual accents per page
- Avoid dense text blocks
- Pages should feel complete without excessive scrolling

Navigation:
- Simple and predictable navigation
- No hidden or experimental navigation patterns
- Users should always know where they are
- Navigation must not compete with content

Typography:
- Typography should carry most of the visual weight
- No decorative or playful effects
- Clear distinction between headings, body text, and meta text
- Readability is more important than expressiveness

Interaction & motion:
- Interactions must be subtle and purposeful
- Avoid animations that exist only to attract attention
- Motion may only be used to:
  - clarify hierarchy
  - indicate state changes
  - support understanding
- Prefer instant feedback over animated transitions

Scrolling & flow:
- Natural scrolling behavior
- No scroll-jacking, parallax, or auto-triggered animations
- Content should reveal through layout, not effects

Components:
- Use a small set of reusable, consistent components
- Components should be visually quiet
- Avoid heavy card designs, large shadows, or visual noise
- Interactive elements must clearly look interactive

Calls to action:
- CTAs should be understated
- No urgency language
- No dominant visual treatment
- Prefer links or secondary-style buttons

Accessibility & clarity:
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Keyboard navigation should be possible
- No interaction should surprise the user
- Clarity always takes precedence over novelty

Required pages:
1. Landing page (/)
2. About (/about)
3. Projects overview (/projects)
4. Project detail: lœrn (/projects/loern)
5. Principles (/principles)
6. Contact (/contact)
7. Legal pages (/legal/imprint, /legal/privacy)

Page-specific guidance:

Landing page:
- Introduce the company and its perspective on AI
- Convey "Good AI" implicitly through structure and emphasis
- Present lœrn as a current project
- lœrn must be clearly marked as:
  "Coming soon to Play Store & App Store"
- No feature lists and no technical deep dives

About page:
- Explain motivation and perspective, not company history
- Emphasize thoughtful decision-making around AI usage
- Avoid positioning the company as a service provider for hire

Projects overview:
- Brief project listings
- Structure must allow easy future extension
- Currently only one project: lœrn

Project page (lœrn):
- High-level description only
- Focus on intent and philosophy, not implementation
- Explicitly avoid detailed feature breakdowns
- Clearly marked as not yet released

Principles page:
- This is a key page
- Principles must be framed as concrete product decisions,
  not marketing claims
- Include a clear stance on restrained and transparent AI usage
- Each principle should be short, direct, and specific

Contact page:
- Simple and low-friction
- No contact forms that imply data collection

Legal pages:
- Clean, minimal, and clearly separated

Explicitly avoid:
- Hero videos
- Auto-playing media
- Parallax effects
- Animated counters
- Sales funnels or conversion-focused patterns
- Startup-style hype sections

Output requirements:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear file and page hierarchy
- SEO-friendly headings
- Easily maintainable and extensible
- No unnecessary complexity
