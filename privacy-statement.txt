Last Updated: February 5, 2026

INTRODUCTION

This privacy statement describes how lœrn ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information. lœrn is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your learning data should remain yours and yours alone.

---

CORE PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

Privacy-First Design
lœrn is built from the ground up to protect your privacy:
- Zero cloud dependencies: All your data stays on your device
- No user accounts: No registration, no login, no tracking
- No personal data collection: Your learning content is anonymous by default
- Offline-first: The app is fully functional without an internet connection

---

DATA WE DO NOT COLLECT

We explicitly do NOT collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- User accounts or login credentials
- Learning content or study materials you create or import
- Learning progress or statistics
- Usage analytics or telemetry data
- Device information or unique identifiers (except as required by ad networks for free users)
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Location data
- Contact lists or social connections

---

DATA STORAGE

Local Storage Only
All of your data is stored exclusively on your device:
- Learning decks and flashcards
- Study progress and statistics
- User preferences and settings
- Profile information (name, icon, language preference)
- Review history and spaced repetition data

This data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device and is protected by your device's built-in security (iOS Data Protection, Android Keystore).

No Cloud Sync
We do not offer cloud synchronization or backup services. Your data never leaves your device through our app.

---

INTERNET CONNECTIVITY

Network Isolation
The app is designed with strict network isolation:
- Core learning features work 100% offline
- Only the advertising module (for free users) can access the internet
- The learning core has no network access whatsoever

When Internet Is Used (Free Version Only)
If you are using the free version of lœrn, the app displays advertisements. The advertising module requires internet access to:
- Load advertisement content
- Report ad impressions and clicks to ad networks
- Comply with advertising network requirements

The ad networks we use (Google AdMob) may collect certain data according to their own privacy policies, which may include:
- Device advertising identifier
- IP address
- Device type and operating system
- Ad interaction data

For detailed information about how Google processes advertising data, please visit:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

Premium Version
If you purchase the premium version (one-time purchase):
- All advertising is completely removed
- The ad module is not initialized
- The app has zero network access
- Your device remains completely offline while using lœrn

---

IN-APP PURCHASES

Purchase Processing
When you purchase the premium version:
- The transaction is processed entirely by Apple App Store or Google Play Store
- We do not collect or store your payment information
- We only receive a confirmation that the purchase was completed
- Premium status is stored locally on your device only

The purchase is tied to your App Store or Play Store account, not to lœrn. Your payment information is handled exclusively by Apple or Google according to their respective privacy policies.

---

IMPORT AND EXPORT

File-Based Data Exchange
You can import and export learning decks as JSON or ZIP files:
- Imported files are processed locally on your device
- Exported files contain only learning content (flashcards, questions, answers)
- No personal information is included in exported files
- You are solely responsible for the content you import and how you share exported files

Copyright and Content Responsibility
lœrn is a tool, not a content provider. You are responsible for:
- Ensuring you have the right to use any content you import
- Complying with copyright laws when sharing exported decks
- The legality of any materials you store in the app

---

PROFILES

Multi-Profile Support
lœrn supports multiple user profiles on a single device:
- Each profile has isolated learning data
- Profiles are identified only by a name and icon you choose
- Profile data never leaves your device
- Deleting a profile permanently removes all associated data from your device

Premium Status
Premium purchase status applies to all profiles on a device (it is tied to the App Store/Play Store account, not individual profiles).

---

NOTIFICATIONS (OPTIONAL)

Learning Reminders
You may optionally enable learning reminders:
- Reminders are scheduled locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers for reminder scheduling
